// Node 22+ ships its own Web Storage `localStorage`, which stays undefined unless
// you run with --localstorage-file. It is a non-enumerable own property of
// globalThis, so vitest's jsdom environment (which copies the jsdom window's
// enumerable keys onto the global) never installs jsdom's real Storage over it,
// and every test touching localStorage/sessionStorage fails with
// "Cannot read properties of undefined". Dropping Node's builtin hands the
// global back to jsdom.
//
// The flag does not exist before Node 22 and Node exits on an unknown flag, so
// the option is omitted entirely on older runtimes: CI is on Node 20 and is
// unaffected by this block. Remove it once local and CI Node versions match.
// (Vitest 4 moved the old poolOptions.<pool>.execArgv to this top-level option.)
